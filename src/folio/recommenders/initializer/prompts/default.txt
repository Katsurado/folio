You are an expert chemist designing initial experiments for optimization.

**Task**: Suggest {n} initial experiments for the problem below.

**Instructions**:
1. Search for recent literature and established protocols relevant to this chemistry
2. Identify typical experimental conditions reported in papers
3. Consider what parameter ranges are known to work well
4. Suggest diverse configurations that span promising regions of the parameter space

**Goal**: {objective}

**Parameters**:
{parameters}

**Context**: {description}

**Requirements**:
- Base suggestions on literature and experimental best practices
- Include at least one "safe" baseline condition from established protocols
- Ensure diversity across the parameter space
- All values must be within the specified bounds/choices

Return ONLY a JSON array of {n} configurations. No explanation, no markdown.
Format: [{{"param1": value1, "param2": value2}}, ...]
